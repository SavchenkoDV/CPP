# C++ Modules

This project includes a series of assignments designed to master the fundamental concepts of C++ programming, including memory management, object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithm development. Through these modules, I gained practical experience in C++ and strengthened my understanding of low-level programming concepts, preparing me for future software engineering roles.

## Module_00

A simple C++ application to understand the basics of C++ syntax, variables, and data types. Focuses on functions, input/output operations, and the structure of a basic C++ program.

## Module_01

A C++ program implementing conditional statements, loops, and arrays. Demonstrates control flow and data manipulation in C++.

## Module_02

Object-oriented programming principles, focusing on the creation of classes and objects. Includes constructors, destructors, and member functions for managing data.

## Module_03

A C++ application using inheritance and polymorphism. Demonstrates inheritance, overriding methods, and dynamic binding.

## Module_04

A C++ application for advanced data handling, focusing on dynamic memory allocation and custom memory management. Includes pointers, references, and memory leak handling.

## Module_05

A C++ program implementing and manipulating data structures like linked lists, stacks, and queues. Implements algorithms for managing dynamic data.

## Module_06

A C++ application demonstrating exception handling and file I/O. Includes error management with try-catch blocks and file reading/writing techniques.

## Module_07

A C++ application implementing operator overloading and custom data structures. Handles built-in operators and user-defined operators for custom objects.

## Module_08

A C++ project combining complex concepts such as file management, data structures, and advanced object-oriented programming. Solves real-world problems using multiple C++ features.
